Listen, we get it. You're the backbone of the neighborhood, the supplier of midnight snacks, and the keeper of the cold Coke. But does that mean you should be stuck doing inventory like it's 1999? 👵🧮

Seriously, who needs that kind of stress when there's chika to be had and teleseryes to watch? 🤷‍♀️

### Introducing the web app that's about to become your sari-sari store's Fairy Godmother. ✨

- It magically tracks your sales so you can finally stop playing detective with your receipts. 🕵️‍♀️
- It knows your inventory better than your suki knows your gossip.
- It basically does everything but sweep the floor and refill the candy jars. (Hey, we're working on it!)

### Stop squinting at those tiny notebooks and start living your best tindahan life.

Ready to ditch the accounting headaches and embrace the 21st century?

### P.S. If you know a sari-sari store owner who still uses an abacus, tag them – they need this. 😂
